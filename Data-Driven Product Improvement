# Product Improvement Project

## Overview
Hello! My name is @Nickmpou, and this is my first project as part of my journey towards becoming a junior product manager. The goal of this project is to improve product efficiency through data analysis, defining solutions, implementing improvements, and testing them. I utilized MS Project for task management, Google Sheets for data collection and calculation, and various tools for organizing and managing the entire workflow.

This project is part of my learning experience in product management, business administration, and consulting. I am looking to apply these skills in a real-world environment, with a focus on software and tech industries.

## Tools Used:
- **MS Project**: Used for project planning, Gantt charts, and task management.
- **Google Sheets**: Used for data collection, organization, and calculation.
- **GitHub**: To host and share the project files.
- **PDFs**: For final reports and documents summarizing key results.

## Project Files:
- **project_plan.pdf**: Contains the detailed project timeline, resources, and task information.
- **risk_analysis.pdf**: Contains a risk assessment and mitigation strategies for each task.
- **gantt_chart.pdf**: A detailed timeline of the project with task durations, dependencies, and milestones.
- **final_report.pdf**: The final report summarizing the findings and recommendations (if applicable).

## Key Risks:
The project identifies several key risks that may affect the schedule and outcome of the project:

- **R1: Delay in Data Collection**  
  Likelihood: High  
  Impact: High  
  Mitigation Plan: Additional resources or extended work hours

- **R2: Data Quality Issues**  
  Likelihood: Medium  
  Impact: High  
  Mitigation Plan: Implement thorough data validation

- **R3: Delay in Feedback Collection**
